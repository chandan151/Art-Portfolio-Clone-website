	<h2>Cricket</h2>
    <p>I just love cricket. I have been playing cricket since I was 5. I follow it very closely and watch almost every match of team <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team">INDIA.</a> cricket is like a festival in India. My all-time favorite player is Rohit sharma but currently, it is Surya kumar yadav. he is phenomenal he plays his shorts very smoothly, he just has no mercy for bowlers. I just miss playing cricket after moving to Canada.</p>

	<h2>Mobile Games</h2>
    <p>I am a fan of multiplayer mobile games. I enjoy it very much. when I was back home I used to play this game with my brothers for almost 6-8 hours a day. now being in university I don't get that much time to play but I still manage to play a few rounds with my roommates.</p>

	<h2>Hiking</h2>
    <p>I also like to explore the environment around me. I like to hike and see different things and creatures in the surroundings. I am very fond of animals. I had a pet dog in India named robin. we used to hang out together.</p>
    <p>I have visited many hiking places in India and a few in Canada. one of those being bertha lake hills. I went there last summer under a trip of the university's international department.</p>
    <h2>Digital Artwork</h2>
    <p>This has also been my area of interest after the nmed1000 course. I like to do things in photoshop and make something that looks great and means something to me. </p>
