  <p>Hey, this is a digitally enhanced photo of a Pizza-Store. I used the image of the front of the red-swan pizza where I work. I spend every weekend and some weekday evenings working there. I work as a supervisor there and I see this place almost every day. I often picture it in many ways in my mind and this is one of those. I have not made many changes in my artwork because I want it to look as real and clear as possible. I always wanted to see the name of the store in colors not just white, so I put some interesting gradient there and then changed the floor in front to match it with the name.
Another, reason behind using this picture is that I have my second family there. All the employees there are from my country and are incredibly good friends of mine. We often spend time together.
